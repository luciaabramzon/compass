This can lead to more meaningful conversations and a stronger desire to build a connection, reducing the chances of someone disappearing mid-conversation.Additionally, our pay per match system encourages users to be thoughtful and engaged in their interactions. Since a small investment is made with each connection, users are more likely to put in the effort to get to know someone they've chosen to match with. This fosters a sense of value and discourages ghosting someone you've invested in."
